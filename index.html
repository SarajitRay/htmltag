				Re: Eileen Dover university application
			</h3>
			<p>
				Dear Eileen,<br><br>

				Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science<br> faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in<br> the following sections.

			</p>
			<h4>
				Starting dates
			</h4>
			<p>
				We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start <br>at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br><br>

				First semester: 9 September 2016<br>
				Second semester: 15 January 2017<br>
				Third semester: 2 May 2017<br><br>

				Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>

				You can find more information about important university dates on our website.

			</p>
			<h4>
				Subjects of study
			</h4>
			<p>
				At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in <br>the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd <br>like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of <br>priority:<br><br>

				Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)<br>
				Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size <br>exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)<br>
				HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br><br>

				So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, <br>required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
